It lies in the Northern part of the continent, stretching 5 million square miles, its northern border on the Larete Sea. Eplea has recenty found itself embroiled in a war that is being waged by it eastern neighbors. The Countries in Eastern Coretrum are resource depleted and jealous of their Western Neighbors so have attacked out of jealousy and fear.

<h1>Hauptburg</h1>
<div>Hauptburg is the Capitol city of Eplea. It was the hub of trade, education and innovation for all of Corterum for generations. A true melting pot, scholars, artists, merchants and refugees traveled from all over to make Hauptburg their home, leading to it becoming a true melting pot of people and races of all kind. Due to the recent outbreak of war, Hauptburg is now a shell of the city it once was. Empty buildings, abandoned warehouse and bombed out homes, the only buisnesses left running are the factories. 
<h1>Magic and Monsters in Corterum</h1>
<div> Corterum is a post Industrial Revolution conteninent and because of this, civilization has expanded and the wilderness has shrunk. Monsters which once ran rampant across the land of Corterum have been beaten back using a combination of steel, gunpowder and magic and are now faint memories in most peoples minds. With the death of monsters, heroes also faded away and are now simply figures in history books and fariy tales. With monsters defeated, much of the world has turned towards fighting each other, which has lead to a decline in the great mages, sorcerors and scholars of the past as well. Magic is now viewed by the governments as a tool of destruction and warfare. The only Wizard Acadmies are now government run  for military conscripts and the old masters rarely take new apprentices.
